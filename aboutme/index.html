    <p>Hi everyone, I live in North Idaho with my husband and two toddlers.</p>
    <p>I am a junior, and I am going for a bachelors in Computer Information Technology.
         I have a degree in Administrative Assistant/Office Manager, but I felt like I needed to come back to school.
        I am a stay at home mom, who has a home bakery called Mayas Kitchen through Facebook as well as a newly published author. </p>
        <p>I am taking this course because I always thought web design was interesting, even though I have no idea what I am doing. I look forward to learning from you all and look forward to getting to know you!</p>
        <p>I have been a member my whole life but inactive until i was 17; thats a long story. I served a mission in the West Indies/ Trinidad Mission. I am constantly trying to do better, and help my family.
             I am taking this course and degree, because I am trying to get a job at my husbands workplace as Help desk and IT after my kids are in school full time.</p>
